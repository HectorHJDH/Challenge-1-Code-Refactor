# Module 1 Challenge: Code Refactor

## Description

This is the first week challenge in the Bootcamp, I needed to undestand the code provided, find the semantic HTML elements, see the structure of the HTML elements, add some attributes and classes for the css to apply the HTML and refactor code in both in the index.html and in the style.css for it to be cleaner and more understandable.
